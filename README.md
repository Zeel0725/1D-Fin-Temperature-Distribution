# 1D Fin Temperature Distribution with Volumetric Heating

This project models the unsteady temperature distribution in a 1D fin subjected to volumetric heating. The simulation considers three different scenarios:
1. Constant heating rate
2. Heating rate varying with length
3. Heating rate varying with time

The project uses **C++** for numerical modeling and the **TDMA (Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm)** for solving the temperature distribution iteratively. Results are visualized using **GNUplot**.

## Overview
This project simulates the temperature distribution in a 1D fin under different heating scenarios. The model was built using C++ for numerical computation and GNUplot for visualizing the results. The purpose of the project is to analyze how temperature varies over time and distance when subjected to volumetric heating.
